3. front end (Angular) with openlayers map
4. make it possible to add a drawing
5. save the measurement in 1 db collection

Upon reload, fetch old measurements from database and display them on the map.

The idea is to demonstrate this and explain the code.
It can be much more minimal than the scr

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 18.1.3.

No, there will be no source given, it is a from scratch todo, for which you can use chatgpt or others to help you set it up.

The deadline is up to you...
We can evaluate today if you like

The important parts are:

- are you capable to use AI tools to do coding
- are you capable to evaluate and understand the code generated
